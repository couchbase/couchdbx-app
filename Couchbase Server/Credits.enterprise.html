The Software may include third party open source software components. If Licensee is the United States Government or any contractor thereof, all licenses granted hereunder are subject to the following: (a) for acquisition by or on behalf of civil agencies, as necessary to obtain protection as “commercial computer software” and related documentation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and as specified in Subpart 12.1212 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R.12.1212, and its successors; and (b) for acquisition by or on behalf of the Department of Defense (DOD) and any agencies or units thereof, as necessary to obtain protection as “commercial computer software” and related documentation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and as specified in Subparts 227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3 of the DOD FAR Supplement, 48 C.F.R.227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3, and its successors.

Support. </span><span class="T9">This Section applies only to Enterprise Licenses, but not to Free Licenses.</span><span class="T6"> </span><span class="T5">Couchbase offers several levels of Support Services for the Software. Couchbase will provide Licensee with the level of Support Services indicated on the Order and paid for by Licensee. For all Licensed Nodes and Embedded Database Instances within a Production Deployment, all such nodes and instances must be at the same level of Support Services, including any instances that are used for disaster recovery or backup that are associated with the Production Deployment. Different Production Deployments can be at different levels of Support Services.  Similarly, as to instances in a development or test environment running the Software, all Licensed Nodes and Embedded Database Instances must be at the same level of Support Services – but such Licensed Nodes may be at a different support level than the Production </span><span class="T5">Deployment(s). When using the Cross Data Center Replication feature, Licensee must have all Licensed Nodes at the same level of Support Services for all instances on all sides of the replication connection, including if one side of the connection is only used for disaster recovery or backup.</span></p><p class="P5"><span class="T5"> </span></p><p class="P5"><span class="T7">5. Payments. </span><span class="T9">This Section applies only to Enterprise Licenses, but not to Free Licenses.  </span><span class="T5">Licensee will pay Couchbase the applicable Subscription Fees and applicable fees as set forth in each Order. All payments of fees or charges under this Agreement shall be made in the currency stated on the Order and are due within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice. Late payments will bear interest at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1½%) per month or the maximum rate allowed by law. In addition, Licensee will reimburse Couchbase for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in collecting any overdue amounts. All fees payable under this Agreement are net amounts and are payable in full, without deduction for taxes or duties of any kind. Fees are exclusive of, and Licensee is responsible for all duties and taxes (including Value Added Tax which shall be paid by Licensee, if applicable, at the rate and in the manner for the time being prescribed by law), except for taxes based on Couchbase’s net income. All fees are non-refundable, except to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement.</span></p><p class="P4"/><p class="P5"><span class="T5">5A.  If Licensee sends Couchbase a purchase order (“</span><span class="T8">PO</span><span class="T5">”), the PO will be deemed a binding contract offer, which Couchbase can accept by signing the PO (thereby forming a mutually agreed Order governed by this Agreement); in such case the </span><span class="T10">only</span><span class="T5"> terms listed on the accepted PO which will form part of the Order are the Commercial Details; and all other terms (whether additional or conflicting with the Agreement) on a PO will be void and without effect, even if Couchbase signs the PO.  All accepted POs will automatically be governed by this Agreement (even if the PO does not reference the Agreement). “Commercial Details” means the identified product(s), quantity (e.g, number of Licensed Nodes and/or Embedded Database Instances), price, server size metric, support level, and subscription start and end date.</span></p><p class="P5"><span class="T5"><br/></span><span class="T7">6. Records Retention and Audit. </span><span class="T5">Licensee shall maintain complete and accurate records to permit Couchbase to verify Licensee’s compliance with the Agreement (including the number of Licensed Nodes used by Licensee), and provide Couchbase with such records within ten (10) days of request. Upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, Couchbase may audit Licensee’s use of the Software to assess whether Licensee is in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Any such audit will be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee’s facilities and will not unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s business activities. Licensee will provide Couchbase with access to the relevant Licensee records and facilities. If an audit reveals that Licensee has underpaid fees to Couchbase, then Couchbase will invoice </span><span class="T5">Licensee, and Licensee will promptly pay Couchbase, for such underpaid fees based on Couchbase’s price list in effect at the time the audit is completed. If the underpaid fees exceed five percent (5%) of the Subscription Fee paid by Licensee for the Software, then Licensee will also pay Couchbase’s reasonable costs of conducting the audit.</span></p><p class="P5"><span class="T5"> </span></p><p class="P5"><span class="T7">7. Confidentiality. </span><span class="T5">Licensee and Couchbase will maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information. The receiving party of any Confidential Information of the other party agrees not to use such Confidential Information for any purpose except as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. The receiving party shall protect the secrecy of and prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information using the same degree of care that it takes to protect its own confidential information and in no event shall use less than reasonable care. The terms of this Confidentiality section shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the receiving party will, at the disclosing party’s option, promptly return or destroy (and provide written certification of such destruction) the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by any law or regulation.</span></p><p class="P5"><span class="T5"> </span></p><p class="P5"><span class="T7">8.

Licensee’s obligation to make a payment of any outstanding, unpaid fees shall survive termination of this Agreement. Upon termination or expiration of any license, Order, or this Agreement, Licensee will promptly return or destroy (and provide written certification of such destruction) the applicable Software and all copies and portions thereof, in all forms and types of media. As to a Free License, a party may terminate such license at any time, for convenience by providing written notice to the other party.  The following sections will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement: Sections 2, 3, 5-13.</span></p><p class="P5"><span class="T5"> </span></p><p class="P5"><span class="T7">11.

IN NO EVENT WILL COUCHBASE’S OR ITS LICENSORS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO LICENSEE, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID BY LICENSEE TO COUCHBASE THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ORDER FOR THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE ACT OR OMISSION FIRST GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY. The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that Couchbase has set its prices and entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the limitations of liability specified herein, which allocate the risk between Couchbase and Licensee and form a basis of the bargain between the parties.</span></p><p class="P5"><span class="T5"> </span></p><p class="P5"><span class="T7">12. General. </span><span class="T5">Neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance (except for any payment obligations) due to causes beyond its reasonable control. Neither party will, without the other party's prior written consent, make any news release, public </span><span class="T5">announcement, denial or confirmation of this Agreement, its value, or its terms and conditions, or in any manner advertise or publish the fact of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, Couchbase may use Licensee's name and logo, consistent with Licensee's trademark policies, on customer lists so long as such use in no way promotes either endorsement or approval of Couchbase or any Couchbase products or services. Licensee may not assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without Couchbase’s prior written consent. Any attempt to assign this Agreement, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's successors and permitted assigns. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The failure by either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. All waivers must be in writing and signed by both parties. All notices permitted or required under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person, by confirmed facsimile, overnight courier service or mailed by first class, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the party specified above or such other address as either party may specify in writing. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given upon receipt. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflicts of law rules. The parties expressly agree that the UN Convention for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. Any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Santa Clara County, California and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein. Any amendment or modification to the Agreement must be in writing signed by both parties. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements regarding the subject matter hereof. No additional or conflicting terms set forth on any purchase order, order acknowledgement or other document shall have any force or effect and are hereby rejected unless expressly agreed upon by the parties’ duly authorized representatives in writing. Each of the parties has caused this Agreement to be executed by its duly authorized representatives as of the Effective Date. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this Agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this Agreement or otherwise. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors and this Agreement will not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency between the parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other’s behalf without the other’s prior written consent. Licensee has not relied on the availability of any future version of the purchased product or any future product in making its decision to purchase the Software license.
